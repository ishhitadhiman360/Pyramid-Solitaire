# Pyramid-Solitaire

The objective of the game is to remove pairs of cards that add up to a total of 13, the equivalent of the highest valued card in the deck (king), from a pyramid arrangement of 28 cards. When using the standard 52-card deck, Jacks are valued at 11, Queens at 12, and Kings at 13. However only the visible cards of the pyramid and top cards of stock and waste pile are selectable. We have to get rid of all cards! :)
